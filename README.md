Concurrent.ai is a platform (in early development) that will enable you to get started with machine learning in a rapid and evolvable way.

# concurrentai-infra

## Overview

Concurrent.ai stacks are deployed to Kubernetes via [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) projects. Pulumi is a great fit for Concurrent.ai because its infrastructure as actual code approach (not yaml) makes dynamic generation of deployment configurations for Kubernetes really easy.

For more background on the core components of Concurrent.ai, see **[concurrentai/concurrentai-core](https://github.com/concurrentai/concurrentai-core)**.

## Getting Started (_WIP_)

Follow the [Getting Started](getting-started) guide to get up and running with your own Concurrent.ai stack. Fair warning, it's a lot of setup right now! Many improvements will be coming in the near future though, such as a dedicated CLI and API.

## Roadmap

See the [Concurrent.ai Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/concurrentai/projects/1) project for an up-to-date roadmap.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! A contributing guide will be coming soon. Everyone contributing to Concurrent.ai repositories or engaging in discussion is expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
